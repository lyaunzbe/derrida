    <h1>Derrida: Deconstructing the Classics</h1>
    <p><em>â€œThere are works which common opinion designates as works of art and they are 
    what one must interrogate in order to decipher in them the essence of art. But by what does one recognize, commonly, 
    that these are works of art if one does not have in advance a sort of pre-comprehension of the essence of art?</br>      
    </br>--Jacques Derrida (The Truth in Painting)</em></p>
    <p>
    Prior to turn of the 20th century, the traditional aspects and traits that were thought to make a piece a work of art
    were primarily academic. The best pieces of art were ones that displayed impeccable execution of technique and theory. Things
    like brushwork/linework, realism, setting, and story were all heavily emphasized.</p>
    <p>When Derrida talks about humanity's common perception of what makes a work of art, I believe he is referring to our innate connection 
    to art that replicates the visual aesthetics of reality. Realism, in the context of art, is both comforting and attractive because it 
    brings a sense of familiarity and understanding, without pushing the mental schemas of our mind that defines visual/aesthetic beauty.
    In earlier times, appreciation for the art of the classical realist masters was universal. Upbringing or class had no
    say in the matter, as this was a time when the langauge of art was at its most empirical. It was an every day part of life for everyone.</p>
    <p>The art world has come a long way since, transforming into a completely different vehicle of expression. Beauty, in the most basic way that 
    we understand it, was no longer the primary goal. Modern art movements like Cubism, Post-Modernism, and Surrealism found ways to inject meaning 
    into their work that went beyond the visual plane. Yet, this new world of art, where the statement mattered more then the picture, ended up losing
    it's universal appeal quite quickly, drowning your average layman in unfarmiliar terminology and theory.</br> "It's a 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)">urinal</a> someone ripped out of a bathroom...What the heck makes this a work of art?"</p>
    <p>
    In this project, we seek to merge the past with the present. In the spirit of Jaques Derrida, we will deconstruct the common perception of beauty that
    is found in the works of old by applying modernist techniques through computer manipulation and visualization. Enjoy!
